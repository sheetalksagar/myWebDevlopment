    <h3>Background Image on a HTML element</h3>
    To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property. <br>
    You can also specify the background image in the "style" element, in the "head" section  <br>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Background Image on a Page</h3>
    If you want the entire page to have a background image, you must specify the background image on the "body" element.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Background Cover</h3>
        If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover. <br>
        Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed. <br>
        This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions)
    <br><br>
    <h3>Background Stretch</h3>
        If you want the background image to stretch to fit the entire element, you can set the background-size property to 100% 100%
