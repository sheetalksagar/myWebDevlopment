    <h1>Background Images</h1>
    <h3>Background Image on a HTML element</h3>
    To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property. <br>
    You can also specify the background image in the "style" element, in the "head" section  <br>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Background Image on a Page</h3>
    If you want the entire page to have a background image, you must specify the background image on the "body" element.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Background Cover</h3>
        If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover. <br>
        Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed. <br>
        This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions)
    <br><br>
    <h3>Background Stretch</h3>
        If you want the background image to stretch to fit the entire element, you can set the background-size property to 100% 100%

    <h1>HTML "picture" Element</h1>
    <p>
      The HTML <picture> element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources. <br>
        The "picture> element contains one or more "source> elements, each referring to different images through the srcset attribute. This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device. <br>
        Each "source> element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable.  <br> <br>
        "picture>
          "source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_food.jpg">
          "source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_car.jpg">
          "img src="img_girl.jpg">
        /picture>"
        <picture>
          <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="../img/background2.jpg">
          <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_car.jpg">
          <img src="../img/background1.jpg">
        </picture>
        <br><br>
        Note: Always specify an "img" element as the last child element of the "picture> element. The "img> element is used by browsers that do not support the "picture> element, or if none of the "source> tags matches.
          <br>
         <mark> When to use the Picture Element</mark> <br>
          There are two main purposes for the "picture> element: <br>
          
          <b> 1. Bandwidth</b> 
          If you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large image file. The browser will use the first "source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any of the following elements.
          <br>
         <b> 2. Format Support</b>
          Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. By using the "picture> element, you can add images of all formats, and the browser will use the first format it recognizes, and ignore any of the following elements.
    </p>
  </body>
