    <h1>Image Maps</h1>
        The HTML "map" tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more "area" tags. <br>
        Try to click on the computer, phone, or the cup of coffee in the image below: <br><br>
        Examples : <br>
        "img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">

        "map name="workmap">
        "area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="computer.htm">
        "area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" href="phone.htm">
        "area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Coffee" href="coffee.htm">
        /map>

        <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
        The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click. <br>
        To create an image map you need an image, and some HTML code that describes the clickable areas.<br>
        <hr>
        <h2>The Image </h2>
        The image is inserted using the "img> tag. The only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute:<br>
        img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap" <br>
        The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map. <br>
        Tip: You can use any image as an image map! <br>
        <hr>
        <h2>Create Image Map</h2>
        Then, add a "map> element. <br>
        The "map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute: <br>
        "map name="workmap" <br>
        The name attribute must have the same value as the "img>'s usemap attribute . <br>
        <hr>
        <h2>The Areas</h2>
        Then, add the clickable areas. <br>
        A clickable area is defined using an "area> element. <br>
        <hr>
        <h2>Shape</h2>
        You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values: <br>
        rect - defines a rectangular region <br>
        circle - defines a circular region<br>
        poly - defines a polygonal region<br>
        default - defines the entire region<br>
        You must also define some coordinates to be able to place the clickable area onto the image. <br>
        <br>
        Shape="rect"<br>
        The coordinates for shape="rect" come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis.<br>
        <br>
        So, the coordinates 34,44 is located 34 pixels from the left margin and 44 pixels from the top:<br>
        <br>
        Workplace<br>
        The coordinates 270,350 is located 270 pixels from the left margin and 350 pixels from the top:<br>
        <br>
        Workplace<br>
        Now we have enough data to create a clickable rectangular area:<br>
        <br>
        Example<br>
        "area shape="rect" coords="34, 44, 270, 350" href="computer.htm"><br>
        This is the area that becomes clickable and will send the user to the page "computer.htm":<br>
        <br>
        Workplace<br>
        Shape="circle"<br>
        To add a circle area, first locate the coordinates of the center of the circle:<br>
        <br>
        337,300<br>
        Workplace<br>
        Then specify the radius of the circle:<br>
        44 pixels<br>
        Workplace<br>
        Now you have enough data to create a clickable circular area:<br>
        Example<br>
        area shape="circle" coords="337, 300, 44" href="coffee.htm"><br>
        This is the area that becomes clickable and will send the user to the page "coffee.htm":<br>
        Workplace<br>
        Shape="poly"<br>
        The shape="poly" contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines (a polygon).<br>
        This can be used to create any shape.<br>
        Like maybe a croissant shape!<br>
        How can we make the croissant in the image below become a clickable link?<br>
        French Food<br>
        We have to find the x and y coordinates for all edges of the croissant:<br>
        French Food<br>
        The coordinates come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis:<br>
        Example<br>
        area shape="poly" coords="140,121,181,116,204,160,204,222,191,270,140,329,85,355,58,352,37,322,40,259,103,161,128,147" href="croissant.htm"><br>
        This is the area that becomes clickable and will send the user to the page "croissant.htm":<br>
        French Food<br>
        Image Map and JavaScript<br>
        A clickable area can also trigger a JavaScript function.<br>
        Add a click event to the area> element to execute a JavaScript function:<br>
        Example<br>
        Here, we use the onclick attribute to execute a JavaScript function when the area is clicked:<br>
        map name="workmap">
        area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" onclick="myFunction()">
        /map>
        <br>
        "script>
        function myFunction() {
        alert("You clicked the coffee cup!");
        }
        /script><br><br>
  </body>
